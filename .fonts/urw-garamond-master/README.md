Modification of the URW Garamond No. 8 fonts
============================================

This project aims to provide a Garamond-like font with support for
OpenType and more advanced typographical features (at least, in
comparison with the offerings of some years ago) that can be used by
engines like XeTeX or LuaTeX.

The basis for this work are the fonts made available by (URW)++ as
distributed by the Compreensive TeX Archive Network (CTAN):

    http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/urw/garamond/

The original fonts by URW use the Aladdin Free Public License (AFPL).
For the full text of the license, please see

We welcome any contribution.
